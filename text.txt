Chapter 153 Conversation - Longevity Cultivation, I'm Farming in the System Space

"Exactly," Lin Jing nodded.

Li Yanyu looked at Lin Jing and continued to ask, "Now, your monthly contribution task and other tributes, I suppose, also require ten top-grade elixirs to be submitted, right?"

Lin Jing nodded, "Li Xiong guessed right, that's indeed the case. I also need to submit ten top-grade elixirs each month to meet the requirement."

Hearing this, Li Yanyu frowned. Then he turned to Huang Qingling and said, "Fifty elixirs should still be relatively easy for you. But these ten second-grade top-grade elixirs might not be so easy for Brother Lin."

"Oh, what should we do then?" Huang Qingling frowned.

Li Yanyu didn't answer Huang Qingling, but turned to Lin Jing with a serious expression, "Brother Lin, if you need help, feel free to ask."

"Yes," Huang Qingling's eyes lit up and she said, "If Lin Jing finds it difficult to refine enough elixirs, she can ask Yanyu'er for help with refining a few top-grade elixirs."

Lin Jing clasped his fists and said, "Thank you, Li Xiong. I'd like to try it myself first. After all, this is also my own practice. If I really can't keep up, and need Li Xiong's help, it won't be too late to trouble Li Xiong at that time."

"Well," Li Yanyu said, "Indeed, in such cases, the skill of alchemy improves faster. I locked myself in the alchemy room for half a year before just to improve my alchemy skills. It was through this that I was able to advance to the rank of third-grade alchemist."

"Yes, I can vouch for it. During that time, I even brought her alchemy materials," Li Qingqing said as he walked over.

At this moment, Huang Qingling seemed to suddenly remember something and asked the others, "Could this steward Zheng be seeking revenge?"

"Seeking revenge? What does that mean?" Li Qingqing asked in confusion.

"This steward Zheng has just arrived at Nanshan Fang Market, right? He didn't know Lin Jing before, so how could he seek revenge on him?" Huang Qingling began to explain, "You don't know, when this steward Zheng first arrived, he went to visit the Liu family."

"He must have befriended the patriarch of the Liu family."

"And because of my relationship with him, Liu Yiyuan must be unfriendly to Lin Jing."

"So, for the sake of his grandson, the patriarch of the Liu family asked this steward Zheng to create obstacles for Lin Jing, expel him from Yuebao Building, and then confiscate this courtyard."

"This way, he won't be able to live in the Inner Fang Market anymore."

"Come to think of it, that makes sense," Li Qingqing's eyes lit up, "Liu Yiyuan has been pursuing you for so long, and now Brother Lin lives so close to you, so he must be unhappy about it."

Huang Qingqing nodded, "I think so."

"Last time he even saw the two of us holding hands, and after that, he never showed up again."

"It's very likely that it's because of that time that he felt jealous and acted like this."

Li Qingqing was stunned for a moment, then seized the key information and turned to the two, "Ah, you two were holding hands?"

Then the gossip spirit ignited within him, and he leaned in next to Huang Qingling, "Come on, tell me, what's going on? Do you two really have something?"

Huang Qingling immediately rolled her eyes at him, "Where's your mind wandering off to..."

Then she began to explain.

As another party involved, Lin Jing had to endure Li Yanyu's strange gaze and could only shake his head with a wry smile.
